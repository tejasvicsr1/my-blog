### Why this blog?

> "To effectively communicate, we must realize that we are all different in the way we perceive the world and use this understanding as a guide to our communication with others." - Tony Robbins

As an aspiring researcher, I've come to appreciate the profound truth in Robbins' words. Effective communication is not just about conveying information; it's about bridging the gap between different perceptions of the world. This realization has inspired me to embark on a journey of self-expression and discovery. 

I've noticed that my perception of the world often yields insights that feel uniquely mine. By documenting these observations, I aim to sharpen my ability to articulate complex ideas, create a record of my intellectual growth, and just talk more. This practice of regular writing about my thoughts and experiences will serve as a practical exercise to enhance my communication skills, which are crucial for presenting research findings clearly, collaborating effectively with peers, and become a better communicator in general.

Interestingly, this blog would be one of the few endeavors I'm undertaking that has no immediate visible impact on my professional life. My research, my technical skills, and my analytical abilities are a happy byproduct of a life I dream to live. My writing, however, has no such purpose. It is a reflection of my thoughts, experiences, and emotions - a reflection of me. (Un)fortunately, as I grow older, and I experience more of life, I find myself grappling with increasingly more "meaningful" questions. One such question - "Who are you?" - made me realize I need to describe myself better. By capturing these thoughts and experiences, and from hopefully hearing from people in my life, people I care about, I hope to be able to answer that question better. I want to retrospectively look at different things I talk about, different views I have, and form a better understanding of who I am. Hopefully, cause, I really procrastinate a lot.

Working hard has always been a challenge for me. Things have a way of working out, and I've often managed to get by with minimal effort. However, as I travel and experience more of life, interacting with a diverse range of people, I've noticed a common trait among successful individuals - they work hard. This realization has led me to understand that discipline is key to achieving significant goals. By committing to this blog, a seemingly non-essential (but perhaps actually essential?) activity, I hope to cultivate that discipline. It's a step towards developing the work ethic I've observed in those I admire. You guys, will hold me accountable, right?
